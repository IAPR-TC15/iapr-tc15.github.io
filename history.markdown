IAPR Technical Committee #15 on “Graph based Representations” was created during the meeting of the IAPR governing board in Vienna on 27 August 1996. The scope of the new committee was of interest to a large section of people dealing with graph representations and willing to exchange algorithms and applications in this area. Several activities were planned. Quoting from the original document announcing the birth of this Techincal Committee:

- Workshops on the topics related to this technical committee in order to better federate research works in the community. For instance, it is of importance to define a standard vocabulary and to compile a set of most important open problems related to graphs used for pattern recognition, image processing and computer vision.
- Collaboration projects including several laboratories at an international level should be initiated.
- Students should be exchanged with links to already existing international programs like ERASMUS/SOCRATES.

## Workshops

The IAPR-TC15 Workshop on Graph-based Representations in Pattern Recognition (GbR) is a biennial workshop organized by the IAPR TC15. These workshops provide a forum for presenting and discussing research results and applications in the intersection of pattern recognition and image analysis on one side and graph theory on the other side. They also constitute an important moment of aggregation for the members of TC15, that use these opportunities for discussing and planning the future activities of the technical committee.
