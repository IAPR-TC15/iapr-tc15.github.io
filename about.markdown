# About IAPR-TC15

Technical Committee #15 of the [International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR)](http://www.iapr.org/) is devoted to promote the research on Graph-based Representations in the Pattern Recognition field.

TC15 focuses on leveraging graph theory as a framework for various applications, such as image segmentation, recognition, clustering, and structural knowledge representation. Graphs are used for handling complex data, particularly in scenarios where irregularly sampled or structured data need to be processed efficiently.

TC15 promotes the integration of graph theory with modern computational methods, making it a critical area for advancing technologies in image processing and pattern recognition.

The main research topics are:
- Graph-based methodologies for pattern recognition
- Graph representation of images and shapes
- Graph neural networks
- Graph matching and classification
- Graph distance and similarity measures
- Graph-based learning and clustering
- Graph kernels and graph embeddings
- Graphs in bioinformatics
- Graph in social network analysis
- Irregular (graph) pyramids
- Other graph-based applications in pattern recognition.
