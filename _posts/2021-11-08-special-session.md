ICPRAI 2022 is the 3rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, following the successful [2018 edition](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~icprai18/) located in Montréal, Canada and the [2020 (virtual) edition](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~icprai20/) held in Zhongshan City, China. This edition is organized by the [Laboratoire d’Informatique Paris Descartes (LIPADE)](http://lipade.mi.parisdescartes.fr/?lang=en) at [Université de Paris](https://u-paris.fr/en/), France. 

ICPRAI 2022 is endorsed by the [International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR)](https://iapr.org/).

The conference aims to bring together researchers, students and practitioners of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, to present and discuss new advances in these fields, related to theoretical, methodological developments or novel applications.
Graphs for Pattern Recognition: Representations, Theory and Applications

Graphs have gained a lot of attention in the pattern recognition community thanks to their ability to encode both topological, geometrical, and semantic information. Despite their invaluable descriptive power and their invariance to diverse geometric deformations, their arbitrarily complex structured nature poses serious challenges when they are involved in Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence.

Some challenging Problems are: a non-unique representation of data, heterogeneous attributes (symbolic, numeric, etc.), highly complex algorithms like (sub-)graph matching.

This Special Session intends to focus on all aspects of graph-based representations in Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, from theoretical to applications concerns.

It spans, but is not limited to, the following topics:

- Dynamic, spatial and temporal graphs
- Graph representations and methods in computer vision
- Geometry and Topology in Graphs
- Graph Neural Networks
- Benchmarks for Graphs in Pattern Recognition
- Graph Learning and Classification
- Graph Matching
- Social Networks Analysis
- Graph Representation Learning

Proposed by:

- Walter G. Kropatsch (Vienna University of Technology, Austria),
- Donatello Conte (University of Tours, France),
- Vincenzo Carletti (University of Salerno, Italy)

Submission deadline: ~~(December 15th, 2021)~~ 15 of January 2022.
