Please found the first announcement  of our French Summer school on Graph based Representations. This school will explore Graph
representations and Graph analysis with a focus on graphs encoding real and complex data.

**Where**: Saint Etienne du Rouvray (near Rouen)

**When**: June 24-28, 2024.

The summer school planed over 5 days will consists of formal conferences (mainly in French) and practicals.  Each day will be devoted to one aspect of Graph & Data analysis:

- **Day 1**: Graphs and Algorithms : Main graph properties and important problems on graphs.
- **Day 2**: Semantic Graphs : How a proper graph encoding of our problems can save huge efforts in Graph analysis.
- **Day 3**: Dynamic Graphs: Description and analysis of Graphs varying over time (or an other dimension).
- **Day 4**: Graph signal Processing: How to analyses a signal on graphs.
- **Day 5**: Graphs and Machine learning: From historical methods to Graph neural network passing through graph kernels.

This summer school is open to any one with a master level in computer science/mathematics and able to follow lectures in French. Practicals will be provided in Python.
